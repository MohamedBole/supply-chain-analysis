# Supply Chain Data Analysis Project Objectives

**Date**: March 17, 2025  
**Prepared by**: Team 1 (DEPI) 
 
The following objectives aim to analyze the entire supply chain system—procurement, production, inventory, and distribution—using the provided dataset. Each objective is specific, measurable, achievable, and relevant to optimizing supply chain performance.

## 1. Optimize Procurement Costs and Efficiency
- **Objective**: Evaluate suppliers (Supplier 1–5) by comparing average manufacturing costs and lead times to identify the top 3 suppliers offering the lowest costs and fastest delivery for each product type (haircare, skincare, cosmetics).
- **Key Metrics**: Supplier name, Manufacturing costs, Lead time, Product type.
- **Purpose**: Balance cost and speed in sourcing decisions.

## 2. Enhance Production Quality and Cost-Effectiveness
- **Objective**: Analyze defect rates and inspection results across SKUs to determine which product types and suppliers have the highest quality (lowest defect rates and highest pass rates), while assessing manufacturing costs to recommend cost-effective production improvements.
- **Key Metrics**: Defect rates, Inspection results, Manufacturing costs, Product type, Supplier name.
- **Purpose**: Improve product quality while controlling production expenses.

## 3. Improve Inventory Management
- **Objective**: Assess stock levels, availability, and number of products sold to calculate inventory turnover rates for each SKU, aiming to identify overstocked or understocked products and recommend optimal order quantities.
- **Key Metrics**: Stock levels, Availability, Number of products sold, Order quantities, SKU.
- **Purpose**: Align inventory with demand to reduce waste and shortages.

## 4. Reduce Logistics Costs and Delivery Times
- **Objective**: Compare shipping carriers (A, B, C), transportation modes (Road, Air, Sea, Rail), and routes (A, B, C) to find the combinations with the lowest shipping costs and shortest shipping times per unit sold, targeting a 10% reduction in average logistics costs.
- **Key Metrics**: Shipping carriers, Transportation modes, Routes, Shipping costs, Shipping times, Number of products sold.
- **Purpose**: Optimize distribution for cost-efficiency and speed.

## 5. Maximize Revenue Across the Supply Chain
- **Objective**: Identify the top 10 revenue-generating SKUs and analyze their supply chain characteristics (supplier, shipping carrier, production volumes, stock levels) to determine key factors driving profitability and prioritize high-value products.
- **Key Metrics**: Revenue generated, SKU, Supplier name, Shipping carriers, Production volumes, Stock levels.
- **Purpose**: Enhance profitability by focusing on high-performing products.
