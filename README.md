# Supply Chain Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on optimizing a supply chain system. The dataset includes information on procurement, production, inventory, and distribution for various product SKUs (haircare, skincare, cosmetics). The goal is to derive actionable insights to improve efficiency, reduce costs, enhance quality, and maximize revenue across the supply chain.

## Contents
- **`objectives.md`**: Defines the project objectives, covering key supply chain aspects:
  - Optimize procurement costs and efficiency.
  - Enhance production quality and cost-effectiveness.
  - Improve inventory management.
  - Reduce logistics costs and delivery times.
  - Maximize revenue across the supply chain.
- **`dataset.csv`** (optional): The supply chain dataset with columns like SKU, Price, Revenue generated, Shipping costs, Defect rates, and more. (Upload your dataset file and update this line accordingly.)

## Project Objectives
The analysis targets a comprehensive evaluation of the supply chain:
1. Identify top-performing suppliers by cost and lead time.
2. Assess product quality through defect rates and inspection results.
3. Optimize inventory turnover to balance stock and demand.
4. Minimize shipping costs and times by comparing carriers and modes.
5. Highlight high-revenue SKUs and their supply chain drivers.

## How to Use
- Review `objectives.md` for the project’s goals and key metrics.
